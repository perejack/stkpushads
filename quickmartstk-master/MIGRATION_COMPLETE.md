# QuickMart STK Push - Migration to PesaFlux Complete! 🎉

## ✅ Migration Summary

Successfully migrated from **PayHero** to **PesaFlux** payment gateway with Supabase database integration.

## 🔧 What Was Changed

### Backend Functions (Netlify Functions)

1. **`functions/initiate-payment.js`**
   - ✅ Replaced PayHero API with PesaFlux STK Push
   - ✅ Integrated Supabase database to store transactions
   - ✅ Uses PesaFlux endpoint: `https://api.pesaflux.co.ke/v1/initiatestk`
   - ✅ Stores transaction with status: `pending`

2. **`functions/payment-status.js`**
   - ✅ Now queries Supabase database instead of PayHero API
   - ✅ Returns status in PayHero-compatible format for frontend
   - ✅ Maps database status: `success` → `SUCCESS`, `failed`/`cancelled` → `FAILED`

3. **`functions/payment-callback.js`**
   - ✅ Handles PesaFlux webhooks
   - ✅ Updates transaction status in Supabase
   - ✅ Ignores timeout webhooks (ResponseCode: 1037)
   - ✅ Properly handles success (0), cancelled (1032/1031), and failed responses

4. **`functions/supabase.js`** (NEW)
   - ✅ Supabase client configuration
   - ✅ Shared across all functions

5. **`functions/package.json`**
   - ✅ Replaced `axios` with `@supabase/supabase-js`

### Frontend (No Changes Required!)
- ✅ Existing UI remains unchanged
- ✅ `script.js` works as-is (calls same endpoints)
- ✅ Polling logic unchanged
- ✅ User experience identical

## 🔑 Credentials Used

- **PesaFlux API Key**: `PSFXyLBOrRV9`
- **PesaFlux Email**: `frankyfreaky103@gmail.com`
- **Supabase URL**: `https://dbpbvoqfexofyxcexmmp.supabase.co`
- **Supabase Table**: `transactions`

## 📊 Database Schema

Uses the same `transactions` table from the main PESAFLUX project:
- `transaction_request_id` (unique)
- `status` (`pending`, `success`, `failed`, `cancelled`)
- `amount`, `phone`, `email`, `reference`
- `receipt_number`, `transaction_id`
- `merchant_request_id`, `checkout_request_id`
- `result_code`, `result_description`
- `transaction_date`, `created_at`, `updated_at`

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd functions
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Webhook in PesaFlux Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://pesaflux.co.ke/user
   - Set webhook URL to: `https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/payment-callback`

3. **Deploy to Netlify**
   - Push to GitHub
   - Netlify will auto-deploy

4. **Test Payment Flow**
   - Initiate payment → Status: `pending`
   - Complete payment → Webhook updates → Status: `success`
   - Cancel payment → Webhook updates → Status: `cancelled`

## 🎯 Payment Flow

```
User initiates payment
    ↓
initiate-payment function
    ↓
PesaFlux STK Push API
    ↓
Transaction saved to Supabase (status: pending)
    ↓
Frontend polls payment-status every 5s
    ↓
User completes/cancels on phone
    ↓
PesaFlux sends webhook to payment-callback
    ↓
Webhook updates Supabase status
    ↓
Frontend detects status change
    ↓
Shows success/failed screen
```

## ✨ Key Features

- ✅ Real-time status updates via webhooks
- ✅ Proper handling of pending/success/cancelled/failed states
- ✅ Ignores timeout webhooks (keeps transaction pending)
- ✅ Database-backed transaction tracking
- ✅ Existing UI preserved (no frontend changes)
- ✅ Same user experience as before

## 🧪 Testing

Test the complete flow:
1. Visit the site
2. Click "Activate Account"
3. Enter phone number
4. Click "Proceed to Pay"
5. Complete/cancel payment on phone
6. Verify status updates correctly

## 📝 Additional Fixes Applied

### ✅ Success Message Updated

**Issue:** After successful payment, the page showed "Account Activated!" instead of proper congratulations message.

**Fix:** Updated success step to show user-requested message:
- **Title:** "Congratulations!"
- **Message:** "Application completed successfully! You will be contacted within 7 days."

**Files Modified:**
- `index.html` - Updated success step content
- `script.js` - Updated status message for successful payment

**Before:** "Account Activated!" → "Your payment was successful and your account has been activated."

**After:** "Congratulations!" → "Application completed successfully! You will be contacted within 7 days."

This provides a better user experience and matches the expected message format.

## 🎉 Migration Complete!

The QuickMart STK Push project now uses the same proven PesaFlux + Supabase integration as the main PESAFLUX project, ensuring reliable and real-time payment processing!
